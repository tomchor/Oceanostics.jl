## Quick example

The example below illustrates a few of Oceanostics' features. Check the Examples for more detailed
usage.

julia> using Oceanostics

julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(4, 5, 6), extent=(1, 1, 1));

julia> model = NonhydrostaticModel(grid=grid, closure=SmagorinskyLilly());

julia> simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1, stop_time=10);

julia> simulation.callbacks[:progress] = Callback(ProgressMessengers.TimedMessenger(), IterationInterval(5));
